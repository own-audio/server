[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/); versions follow
semver. Each release states the **API contract revision** it serves
(`GET /api/v1/server` → `api.revision`), see `docs/API_COMPATIBILITY.md`.

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- The server, imported from the private codebase behind own.audio as a
  snapshot (no history) at its version 0.1.56 — audiobooks, podcasts, music,
  families with parental controls, playback sync, the own.audio folder sync
  protocol, an OpenSubsonic surface, and the web console.
- `GET /api/v1/server`: edition, version, API revision and the `features`
  map every client gates on. Contract revision **1**.
- `GET /api/v1/family/storage`: a family's bytes per media kind.
- Per-IP rate limits on login, refresh, device codes, join codes and setup
  (`SERVER__RATE_LIMIT__*`), answering `429 rate_limited` with `Retry-After`.
- `501 feature_unavailable` for routes of features this edition does not
  offer (billing, narration, translation).
- Conformance suite (`conformance/`, 330 checks) runnable against any server.

### Removed (relative to the hosted codebase)
- Billing, payments, the narration and translation pipelines, the operator
  console — hosted-only, see `docs/SCOPE.md`.
